At this Point we are using the following Premier account (RHAPSODY_PREMIER)
names corresponding to each of the servers probed:

qa_spot-monitor-flash01_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash02_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash03_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash04_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash05_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash06_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash07_rp@rhapsody.lan
qa_spot-monitor-flash08_rp@rhapsody.lan

Password for all of these will then be:  spotflashqa
Any new servers will need an account that follows this pattern, and the premier
account names should be listed above AND this listing should exist both on the
installed server configuration area AND IN SUBVERSION.
